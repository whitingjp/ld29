A human munching baby-making wyrm simulator
  by Jonathan Whiting

Dig around, eat some humans, get long, get
pregnant, have a baby "It's an.. egg!", have
another, squabble with your children for food,
dodge the weird drill things.  Do something
else.  Made as part of Ludum Dare 29.

Controls:
  Left and right arrows, or a and d.
