A human munching baby-making wyrm simulator
  by Jonathan Whiting

Dig around, eat some humans, get long, get
pregnant, have a baby "It's an.. egg!", have
another, squabble with your children for food,
dodge the weird drill things.  Do something
else.  Made as part of Ludum Dare 29.

Controls:
  Left and right arrows, or a and d.

A note on Linux build:
  Requires glfw glu gl and soil runtimes.
  On ubuntu:
    apt-get install libglfw2 libglu1-mesa libsoil1
  Will *hopefully* do the trick. Please please
  please let me know if you do/don't have any
  luck, I really want to learn how to make
  reliably easy to run linux builds.
