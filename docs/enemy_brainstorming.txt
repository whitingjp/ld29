Movement types:
 * Drill straight down.
 * 'Blowtorch' in changing direction.
 * Fly above surface.
 * Ignores land entirely, slow, rethinks positioning.
 * Parachute in, walk around.

Attacks:
 * Side 'ray', triggered when egg height reached.
 * Big bomb, triggered by passing through enough air.
 * Launch different enemy/s.
 * Small bomb, only triggered when reaching egg.



Plane - drops paratroopers.
Paratrooper - launch real threat shortly after landing, then walking around, after a recharge time can launch another threat.
Side driller - drills down fairly quickly, when it hits egg level it charges up (now invincible?) and lasts sideways, can eat enroute, or block blast with body as last ditch attempt.
Big bertha - explodes if near worm, drops through earth *slowly*, but detonates if hitting earth after moving through too much air (unstable).
Drone - darts around erratically, but not quickly, semi-cloaked and inedible when moving, pauses and 'wakes up' to choose next direction.  If it reaches the egg, *pop*.
